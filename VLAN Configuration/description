We creat Vlan - Virtual LAN in the switch. 
VLAN is used to separate multiple departments in an organization in this way that different dept cannot talk and share something with each other.
Only same dept will share with each other. 

Main reason to use VLAN is to control and minimize the scope of broadcasting process of a switch. Thus only same VLAN will get the broadcasting
request. This will incrase the efficiency of the switch to establish communication as it will only focus on the same vlan.
